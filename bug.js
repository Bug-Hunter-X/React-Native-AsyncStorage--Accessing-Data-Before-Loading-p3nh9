This React Native bug occurs when using AsyncStorage to store and retrieve data.  The issue is that when a component attempts to access data from AsyncStorage before it has been fully loaded, it results in undefined or null values, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes. This is often seen in scenarios where the app loads and immediately tries to render a component that depends on data fetched from AsyncStorage, but that data hasn't finished loading.
